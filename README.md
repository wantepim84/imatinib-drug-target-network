# imatinib-drug-target-network

A fully interactive 3D drug–target interaction network for the anticancer drug Imatinib, visualizing its atom-level binding with five key protein targets.
The project combines RDKit, NetworkX, and Plotly to generate complete molecular bond graphs and highlight interaction atoms using red dotted edges.
Showcases practical skills in computational chemistry, graph theory, and life-science data visualization.
